# Implementing the web API of the website

Now that our database is up and runnnig, we need to create the code that connects the user facing interface with the backend. 
This means that we need to have a server running that accepts requests from the user interface, it forwards them to the backend and then delivers back a response. 
Most of the time, the middleware extracts the user input and creates the appropriate query that is passed to the backend. 
However, there are situations where some actions need to be taken on the middleware side.
